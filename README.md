# BansToDiscord
BansToDiscord is a simple spigot plugin that allows you to display bans and kicks from a Minecraft server on a Discord server. This is helpful, for example, because team members see immediately when someone is banned.
Unfortunately, at the moment it is only possible to display bans if the player being banned at that moment is online.
## How to use
Have a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/AljoshaVieth/BansToDiscord/wiki/Getting-Started)
## How it works
This plugin creates its own bot that sends ban and kick messages from the Minecraft server directly to a channel on a discord server.
